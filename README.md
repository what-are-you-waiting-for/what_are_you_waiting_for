This is what_are_we_waiting_for - an [Opal](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal) project.

To get started, run the following commands:

```
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
```


Or if Opal is new to you:

mkvirtualenv hackday
workon hackday

pip install opal

pip install -r requirements.txt

./manage.py migrate

./manage.py createsuperuser

./manage.py runserver


go to http://localhost:8000

login as the superuser you just created.
